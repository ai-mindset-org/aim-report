# 9. Vibe Coding (2025 Cultural Phenomenon)

## Origin
- **Coined:** February 6, 2025 by **Andrej Karpathy** (OpenAI co-founder, former Tesla AI lead)
- **Definition:** "Fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists"

## Karpathy's Description
> "I barely even touch the keyboard... I ask for things like 'decrease the padding on the sidebar by half' and always click 'Accept All' without reading the diffs anymore."

> "Sometimes when LLMs can't fix a bug, I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away."

## Cultural Impact
- Listed on **Merriam-Webster** website (March 2025)
- Named **Word of the Year** by **Collins English Dictionary**
- Featured in NYT, Ars Technica, Guardian

## Industry Response

### Criticism
- **Andrew Ng:** Misleads people into assuming software engineers "go with the vibes"
- **September 2025:** Fast Company reported "vibe coding hangover" with senior engineers citing "development hell"

### Defense
- Distinction: "building software with an LLM without reviewing the code it writes"
- Works for "throwaway weekend projects"

## Karpathy's Prediction
> "Vibe coding will terraform software and alter job descriptions"
> "This new body of code is free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable after single use"

- **High school principal:** Deepfake racist/antisemitic audio nearly destroyed careers

## Technology Accessibility
- Voice cloning: requires **20-30 seconds** of audio
- Convincing video deepfakes: **45 minutes** with free software

## Detection Challenges
- Deepfake detection tools **cannot reliably catch** AI-generated content
- Humans **cannot consistently identify** AI-generated voices
- Approaching **"synthetic reality threshold"** – humans can't distinguish without tech assistance

## Regulatory Response
- **Take It Down Act** (May 19, 2025): Criminalizes non-consensual deepfake images
- **EU AI Act:** Transparency obligations, technical marking for AI content
- **Louisiana HB 178** (August 1, 2025): First statewide framework for AI-generated evidence

## The "Liar's Dividend"
> "The ability to dismiss authentic recordings as probable fakes creates a double bind where neither belief nor disbelief in evidence can be justified."
