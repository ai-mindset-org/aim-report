    <p>we're not a research institute. we're a lab — a place where people practice AI.</p>
    
    <strong>1,500+ participants</strong> across <strong>10+ countries</strong>, <strong>3 years</strong> of field work.
    
    <p>this report isn't desk research. it's hardened by field notes from labs, artifacts from community, and real shifts people are living through.</p>
    
    <h2>why this matters:</h2>
    
    <strong>the crisis:</strong>
    
    <strong>loss of agency</strong> — you outsource decisions faster than you gain capability. every "ai will handle it" compounds dependency.
    
    <strong>reliability tax</strong> — you spend more time verifying ai output than it would take to do it yourself. the promise of efficiency becomes a trap of constant auditing.
    
    <strong>responsibility void</strong> — when ai makes the call, who takes the blame? humans abdicate judgment. machines have no skin in the game.
    
    <p>most ai discourse happens at extremes: utopian hype from consultancies, existential panic from media, optimization obsession from tech leaders. the future of humanity is being written by technologists and capitalists who view the world from the top down.</p>
    
    <strong>we fill the void.</strong>
    
    <strong>how this report helps:</strong>
    
    <p>it maps the 11 tectonic shifts creating this crisis—so you can see the terrain clearly.</p>
    
    <p>it provides field-tested frameworks from 1,500+ lab participants—so you know what actually works.</p>
    
    <p>it ends with an action plan—the sovereignty reset—so you know exactly what to do next.</p>
    
    <h2>the foundation:</h2>
    
    <p>this report is hardened by the field notes of 1,500+ lab participants and the artifacts of our research. these aren't theoretical frameworks. they're <strong>tested in real conditions</strong> by people who can't afford to get this wrong.</p>
    
    <h2>what to do next:</h2>
    
    <p>you just saw 11 tectonic shifts. energy walls. agentic labor. sovereign stacks. reasoning models. context explosions. synthetic data floods. code generation at scale. physical intelligence. cognitive warfare. ideological filters. synthetic intimacy.</p>
    
    <p>machines are accelerating. humans are buffering.</p>
    
    <p>in 2026, most people won't lose to ai. they'll lose to their own defaults.</p>
    
    <p>your life already runs on configuration: what you say yes to without thinking. what interrupts you without permission. what you outsource because you're tired. what you believe because it was repeated.</p>
    
    <p>we're exploring what it means to move from "i'll try" to "i have defaults."</p>
    
    <h2>some practices we're testing in the labs:</h2>
    
    <strong>simple — start here:</strong>
    
    <p>be mindful. notice when you're accepting ai output without thinking. pause before you trust.</p>
    
    <p>save one idea offline. write it by hand. keep something the algorithm can't see.</p>
    
    <p>turn off one notification. reclaim 10 minutes of uninterrupted thought.</p>
    
    <p>ask "why" before you ask ai. clarify your own thinking first.</p>
    
    <strong>moderate — build habits:</strong>
    
    <p>treat agents as coworkers, not just tools. if you work with AI extensively: onboarding, context, boundaries. HR for AI.</p>
    
    <p>create a personal knowledge base for one domain. local notes, documents you own. your memory outside the cloud. add information so you don't need to search again later.</p>
    
    <p>audit which services have your data. create a checklist: who gets access, who doesn't. close access where you don't trust.</p>
    
    <p>test 3 models on the same question. see how different values shape different answers. when asking for knowledge or ideas, check for bias—verify in multiple models.</p>
    
    <p>implement one context filter. decide what information you don't need, even if it's available. create filters, not folders.</p>
    
    <p>practice analog verification. phone calls for important decisions. handwriting for sensitive thoughts.</p>
    
    <p>couple times a day: don't just accept AI conclusions. verify yourself. understand how biased your daily models are.</p>
    
    <strong>advanced — build systems:</strong>
    
    <p>at least once a week: fully disconnect from devices and information consumption. context obesity needs breaks.</p>
    
    <p>every 2 months: audit your information sources. delete what you don't actually use.</p>
    
    <p>deploy guardian agents. filters for your attention. ai defending against ai overload.</p>
    
    <p>establish secret handshakes with family. pre-agreed phrases for video calls. offline trust verification. warn your parents and grandparents: even if it's your voice, your face — verify before acting. deepfakes are cheap now.</p>
    
    <p>build local-first workflows. on-device ai where privacy matters. no cloud streaming of bedroom cameras.</p>
    
    <p>implement one local-first workflow where privacy matters.</p>
    
    <p>check reasoning traces. never accept output without visible logic. audit, don't just consume.</p>
    
    <p>create zero-trust defaults for digital media. assume fake until cryptographically verified.</p>
    
    <p>opt out where possible. prohibit training on your data. claim your right to be forgotten.</p>
    
    <strong>deep — structural changes:</strong>
    
    <p>shift from creator to consigliere. orchestrate ai, don't compete with it. question: are you orchestrating or abdicating?</p>
    
    <p>practice authorship: own the decision even if AI wrote the code. for non-developers using vibe coding: understand intent architecture, not just output.</p>
    
    <p>value tacit knowledge. invest in skills models can't simulate. craft, sports, embodied intelligence.</p>
    
    <p>support one creator or source with premium organic data. your novelty prevents model collapse.</p>
    
    <p>join or build closed communities with proof-of-human verification. digital bunkers against the dark forest.</p>
    
    <p>practice divergent testing across models with different constitutions. use bias delta to find truth.</p>
    
    <p>trust skin in the game. prediction markets over polls. money where mouth is.</p>
    
    <p>when consuming AI-generated content: ask yourself if this is real. verify provenance.</p>
    
    <p>audit: how much time in AI companionship apps? does it replace or enhance human connection?</p>
    
    <p>reclaim physical reality. spend time in spaces where atoms matter more than bits. practice divergent reality: prioritize atoms over bits.</p>
    
    <p>reclaim one analog ritual: handwritten notes, phone calls, physical craft.</p>
    
    <p>we can't close all the gaps though we at least can be aware of it and act accordingly.</p>
    
    <p>build one personal automation that saves cognitive load, not just time.</p>

    <h2>the sovereignty reset:</h2>
    
    <p>moving from "i'll try" → "i have defaults." 5 concrete steps:</p>
    
    <strong>1. build sovereign stack</strong> — own your memory through personal rag. deploy on-device ai for privacy and energy independence. implement context dieting—aggressive filtering, not more tools.
    
    <strong>2. audit, don't generate</strong> — shift from creator to consigliere mindset. master intent architecture—orchestrate ai, don't execute manually. demand reasoning traces—never accept output without visible logic path.
    
    <strong>3. deploy guardian agents</strong> — protect attention from context obesity with ai filters. implement cognitive firewalls—zero trust default for all digital media. filter aggressively—goal is protection from information, not access to it.
    
    <strong>4. value the tacit</strong> — invest in tacit knowledge—the only thing models cannot simulate. reclaim physical reality: craft, sports, embodied skills. humans are premium organic data—your novelty prevents model collapse.
    
    <strong>5. test divergently</strong> — query 3+ models with different constitutions to see bias delta. trust skin in the game (prediction markets) over media/polls. demand opt-out rights—ability to prohibit training on your data.
